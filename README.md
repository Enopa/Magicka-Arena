# Magicka-Arena
This was my first project ever within Unity. This game was built not only to test my skills within C# and Unity, but also as my A-Level project submission.
I had a lot of fun building this project, it's nice to share its jankiness with the world.

## What is it?
Magicka Arena is a first person shooter revolving around shooting these magic spells than can cause all sorts of effects.
You run around an arena defeating different enemy types.

## Game Modes
There are two basic game modes
* **Survival:** This game mode requires you to survive for as long as possible against the waves of enemies
* **Hunter:** This game mode revolves around you defeating as many enemies as possible within the limited time.

## Spells
There are 7 basic spells you have access to.
Each spell uses up some of your mana
* **Fire:** This spell will cause repeat damage to an enemy
* **Ice:** Hitting an enemy with this spell causes an ice patch to be made. Moving in this ice patch makes you move faster
* **Grass:** Hitting an enemy with this spell restores some health
* **Thunder** Hitting an enemy with this spell restores some mana
* **Wind:** This spell knocks enemies backwards
* **Rock:** Killing an enemy with this spell will generate a shield that allows you to absorb one hit
* **Light:** Killing an enemy with this spell restores all of your mana and health

## Enemies
There are three main enemies as well.
* **Tank:** Big, slow, loads of health and deal loads of damage. You have to be close to them for them to be a threat however. They are also very predictable
* **Chaser:** Fast, nimble and aggressive. These guys will hunt you down and deal damage as soon as they touch you. Be sure to get rid of them quick!
* **Shooter:** These enemies have more brain than the other two. They keep their distance and fire shots, they dont do much damage but are should not be ignored.

## Extras
As mentioned, this was my first ever Unity project, all the textures are just basic colours, there is no sound or anything and there may be a few bugs due to a lack of testing.
But, its still playable, and can be fun, if you ignore the the basic aesthetics...

There are a lot of redundant files here because I did not know what gitignores were when I committed this all lol
